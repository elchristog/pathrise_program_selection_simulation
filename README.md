# Pathrise Program Selection Simulation

This repository contains the Pathrise Program Selection Simulation tool. The tool is designed to help users simulate different salary and cost scenarios for the Pathrise program, and calculate the expected outcomes based on the user's input. This can assist in making an informed decision about which Pathrise program to choose.

## Tool Features
The Pathrise Program Selection Simulation tool allows users to input:

- The minimum and maximum salaries for "Reach", "Target", and "Safety" job roles
- The cost of each Pathrise program
- The percentage of salary that would be paid to Pathrise for each program

The tool then calculates:

- The expected annual and monthly salaries for each job role
- The cap on the cost of each program based on the expected salary and the program's percentage of salary
- The amount of salary left after paying the program costs (both monthly and annually)
- A final score for each job role and program combination, calculated based on the probability of getting the job role, the amount of salary left after paying the program costs, and the job search speed
- The results are displayed in a table that can be sorted and filtered to help users evaluate the different scenarios.

## How to Use
You can access the tool directly via this link: [Pathrise Program Selection Simulation](https://pathriseprogramselectionsimulation-4eura4rey1d.streamlit.app/)

Once on the page, you can use the sliders and number inputs on the left side of the page to adjust the parameters for the simulation. The table on the right will update automatically based on your input.

## Future Improvements
Future updates to this tool could include:

- More detailed scoring that takes into account other factors such as job location, job benefits, etc.
- A feature to save and compare different scenarios
- Improved visuals and graphics for easier interpretation of the results
